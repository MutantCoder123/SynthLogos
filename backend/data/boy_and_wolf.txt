In a quiet village near the hills lived a young shepherd boy whose job was to watch over the sheep. Every day, he sat alone on a hilltop, guarding the flock. Over time, he became bored and lonely.

To entertain himself, one afternoon he shouted, “Wolf! Wolf!” The villagers rushed to help him, carrying sticks and tools. When they arrived note they found no wolf. The boy laughed loudly at their confusion. Angry but relieved, the villagers returned to their work.

The next day, the boy repeated the same trick. Again, the villagers came running, only to be fooled once more. This time, they warned the boy seriously and told him not to lie again.

A few days later, a real wolf appeared and attacked the sheep. Terrified, the boy screamed for help with all his strength. However, the villagers thought he was lying again and ignored his cries.

The wolf killed several sheep before running away. When the villagers finally arrived, they saw the damage and realized the truth. The boy cried in regret, understanding that his lies had cost him trust.

From then on, he promised never to lie again. The villagers forgave him, but they never forgot the lesson.

Moral: Lying destroys trust.
