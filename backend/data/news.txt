CITY INTRODUCES SMART TRAFFIC SYSTEM TO REDUCE CONGESTION

In a major step toward improving urban mobility, the city administration on Tuesday launched a new smart traffic management system aimed at reducing congestion, cutting travel time, and improving road safety. The project, developed over two years, uses real-time data, artificial intelligence, and automated signal control to manage traffic flow more efficiently across key intersections.

According to officials, the system has been installed at over 120 major junctions across the city. High-resolution cameras and sensors monitor vehicle density, speed, and waiting time at each signal. Based on this data, traffic lights automatically adjust their duration, allowing longer green signals on heavily congested roads and reducing unnecessary waiting on empty stretches.

City Traffic Commissioner Anil Verma said the initiative was necessary due to the rapid increase in vehicle numbers. “Over the last decade, the number of registered vehicles has nearly doubled, while road capacity has remained almost the same. Traditional fixed-timer signals were no longer effective,” he explained.

During a three-month pilot run conducted in selected areas, officials reported a reduction of up to 22 percent in average travel time during peak hours. Fuel consumption and vehicle idling were also reduced, contributing to lower air pollution levels. Environmental experts welcomed the move, stating that smoother traffic flow could significantly cut carbon emissions in urban areas.

The system also includes an emergency vehicle priority feature. Ambulances and fire engines equipped with special transmitters can communicate with traffic signals, turning them green automatically to ensure faster response times. Hospital authorities said this could save crucial minutes during medical emergencies.

However, the project has not been without criticism. Some citizens raised concerns about privacy, as the system relies heavily on surveillance cameras. Officials clarified that the cameras do not use facial recognition and that all collected data is anonymized and stored securely.

Local shop owners expressed mixed reactions. While many welcomed reduced congestion, others worried that road changes and signal adjustments could temporarily affect foot traffic and parking access. The administration has promised regular reviews and adjustments based on public feedback.

The smart traffic initiative is part of the city’s broader smart city mission, which includes plans for intelligent street lighting, digital public services, and improved public transport integration. Authorities said future upgrades may include mobile apps that provide real-time traffic updates and alternative route suggestions to commuters.

Urban planning experts believe such systems are essential for growing cities but emphasized that technology alone cannot solve traffic problems. “Smart signals must be combined with better public transport, pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, and responsible driving behavior,” said transportation analyst Ritu Malhotra.

As the system becomes fully operational over the next few months, officials hope it will set an example for other cities facing similar challenges. For daily commuters, the success of the project will ultimately be measured by one simple factor: whether getting to work becomes faster and less stressful.
