Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, lived a Hare who was very proud of his speed. He would often boast about how fast he could run and make fun of other animals for being slow. One day, he noticed a Tortoise moving calmly along the forest path. Laughing loudly, the Hare mocked the Tortoise and challenged him to a race.

The Tortoise accepted the challenge without anger or pride. The animals of the forest gathered to watch the race. The Fox marked the starting line and announced the rules. As soon as the race began, the Hare dashed forward like the wind, leaving the Tortoise far behind. Confident that he had already won, the Hare decided to rest under a shady tree.

Meanwhile, the Tortoise continued walking slowly but steadily, never stopping, never doubting himself. The Hare fell asleep, dreaming of victory celebrations. When he finally woke up, the sun was beginning to set. He jumped up in panic and ran as fast as he could toward the finish line.

But it was too late. The Tortoise, who had never stopped moving, crossed the finish line just moments before the Hare arrived. The forest erupted in cheers. The Hare stood stunned and ashamed, realizing his mistake.

From that day onward, the Hare learned an important lesson about humility and consistency. The Tortoise became a symbol of patience and perseverance. The animals of the forest remembered this race for generations.

Moral: Slow and steady wins the race.
